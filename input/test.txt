Bright spot in Panda Diplomacy today!
Two giant pandas are coming to California! In a move of panda diplomacy and in the spirit of international collaboration, @sandiegozoo will receive two of these vulnerable and majestic speciesâ€”the first new panda loans to the U.S. in 2 decades.
In a promising sign for "panda diplomacy," D.C. will receive a pair of pandas by the end of the year.
